# Satsana-Fan-Duct-Dual-5015-MGN12-rail-BMG-
This is my version of the Satsana Duct, I remixed this design as practice in Fusion 360 
and in order to build exactly what I needed in a print head in the lightest package possible.
Status: Unreleased, alpha soon
Frame Weight: ~60g without hardware
With Components: ~400g

Material: ASA for strength/weight ratio, heat resistance, and to practice ASA printing.
PLA not recommended because hotend will be mounted directly to plastic.

Cura

Octoslicer

My design was made easily possible because of the awesome work and files of eric-anastas
